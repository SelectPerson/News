    “Cracking the Government Procurement Code” which details the results of an extensive study on the\

          strategy and operations, Censeo developed a comprehensive web-based survey to capture the perspectives of small\
           businesses selling to government customers at the federal, state and local levels. The survey was broadly\

              selling to the government. To assess the potential enabling role of online marketplaces in government\
               procurement, the survey also asked respondents about their current usage of online marketplaces and the\
